# Lesson 4 JavaScript Practice Assignment - The Solar System
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to practice creating variables and functions. This lab is focused on:
- Practice and Check my Knowledge of the Java Script concepts discussed in module 4.
Such as: Math Methods, Conditionals, Objects, and Arrays.

### GitHub Link
https://github.com/ANIO-Official/solar-system
### How To Use
1. Clone the repository or Download the ZIP file.
2. Open the index.js file inside of Visual Studio Code.
3. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is installed. Reference [Visual Studio Code's Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)
4. Comment out any console.log you aren't checking.
5. In the terminal run "node index.js" to each console.log (that isn't commented out.)

## My process
Here are my general methods for completing tasks:
 - To access object data, use dot notation. I find this method more straight forward than brackets.

    Example: system.mercury.velocity.

 - To access array items, use bracket notation and call item by their index number.

    Example: solarSystem[8]

 - To access key values in objects *within* an array, combine both array bracket & object dot notation.

    Example: solarSystem[7].moons[1]

 - For all console.logs, I chose to use template literals to make sure it was easy to read.

    Example: console.log(`Venus got a moon update! Welcome, ${solarSystem[1].moons}!`)

    Other than this, I made sure to leave comments to explain areas as necessary for both me and you the one reading this :>
